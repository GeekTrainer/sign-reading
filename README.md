# AI Code Solution

If you're a little lost, don't want to type out the code, or simply want to see the solution site in action, this is the folder for you. This folder contains the working site so you can see [Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision), [Translator Text](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/) and [Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/face/) in action!

## Setup

In order to run the solution site, there is a little work which needs to be done. You will need [Python](https://python.org) installed locally, a few libraries, and keys on Azure to support calling the services.

### Installing Python

To install Python, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions for installtion for your operating system.

> **NOTE**: If you use Windows, make sure you check the option to **Add Python 3.8 to PATH**. This will enable to use the Python command-line utlities.

### Installing Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)

To ease the creation of the necessary keys, we will use the Azure CLI. By using the Azure CLI you can copy/paste a few commands to create and obtain the appropriate keys.
